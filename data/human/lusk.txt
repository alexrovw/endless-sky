			`As you enter the spaceport, your attention is immediately drawn to a somewhat disheveled man wearing a cheap black suit with a red and black checkered tie. He scrabbles on the floor on his hands and knees, desperately gathering a pile of loose papers into a briefcase. While others seem to be watching him, nobody has done anything to help.`
			choice
				`	(Help the man gather his belongings.)`
					goto help
				`	(Watch him struggle.)`
				`	(Ignore him and move on.)`
					decline

			`	You watch the somewhat comical display of a grown man rummaging about on the floor as he finishes collecting his papers and rises shakily to his feet. He looks around, somewhat flustered, before focusing in on you and starting to walk in your direction. It seems it's too late to pretend that you weren't watching; he waves at you as he approaches.`
				goto introduction
			
			label help
			`	You join the man on the floor and help him gather the messy papers. He looks up and grunts at you appreciatively as he finishes cleaning up his mess, and you both stand up.`
			label introduction
			`	"Johann Lusk," the man says, by way of greeting. He smiles at you and extends a sweaty hand, evidently expecting you to shake it.`
			choice
				`	(Shake his hand.)`
					goto shake
				`	(Wave to him instead.)`
					goto wave

			label shake
			`	You grasp the man's hand and give it a firm shake. It's clammy and a bit unpleasant, but he seems relieved that you didn't leave him hanging. You take a moment to introduce yourself as well.`
				goto pitch
			label wave
			`	There's no way you're touching that greasy hand. You give him a wave instead and introduce yourself. Looking only a little crestfallen, Johann returns your wave.`
			label pitch
			`	"I hope I'm not being too forward here, but you have the look of a merchant captain about you," Johann says. "I hear your type is always looking for odd jobs, and it just so happens that I have one for you." He takes a moment to slick back his hair a bit before continuing. "You see, I'm in a bit of a pickle. I'm an entrepreneur of sorts and on my way to a very important investor meeting on <destination>. My previously arranged transport has abandoned me here for some reason, and I would thus be much obliged if you were to take me there." He looks at you hopefully, then adds, "there might be a very lucrative opportunity for you if you agree to take me to where I'm going. Also, I can pay you 15,000 credits."`
			choice
				`"Sure, I can help you out."`
					accept
				`"Sorry, I'm not interested."`

		log `Transported a certain "entrepreneur" named Johann Lusk to a business meeting on Ada. He stiffed me on payment.`
		conversation
			`	As soon as you land on <planet>, Lusk is already ready to go. He thanks you profusely as he rushes out of your ship, promising to return in one hour with your payment. There's no way you can catch him without sprinting, so you instead resign yourself to watching him go and hope that he returns with your payment soon.`
			`	Three hours go by and you're just about to write off this boondoggle as a total loss. As you begin to prepare your ship to depart, you manage to spot a severely downcast Lusk reluctantly trudging toward your ship. When he finally reaches your vessel, he seems to invite himself in and walk right past you to collapse into a chair just past the airlock.`
			choice

			`	Lusk emits a long, almost exaggerated sigh. "They didn't go for it. This was supposed to be my big break. Those fools don't understand anything. Those idiots. Those... those..." he seems to be working himself up into a lather. "Those... invertebrates don't know the first thing about mining, and yet they see fit to lecture me about prospecting and mineral rights! As if I didn't do my homework? As if I haven't been planning this endeavor for the past six months? I should have known better than to trust these posh clowns with my idea!"`
			`	You quietly watch what appears to be a man having a breakdown.`
			`	He suddenly pauses his rant and gives you a wild-eyed look. "You! You would understand, right? I'm sure you've mined plenty of asteroids in your time. You know what it's like to have a surefire cash cow." He doesn't stop to let you correct him. "Why wouldn't they listen? You know what? It doesn't matter. You're a reasonable fellow, aren't you? Will you hear me out?" He finally pauses long enough for you to get a word in edgewise.`

				`	"Listen, Johann. If you just pay me what you owe me, I'll be on my way."`

			action
				set "bam: demanded payment"
			`	For the first time since you met him, Lusk looks somewhat meek. "I... don't have it. The investors at the Ada Entrepreneurial Foundation were supposed to invest in my project. I was going to use some of that money to pay you." He looks down at his feet. "Listen, if you insist on payment right now, I will give you everything that I have." He looks at you with pleading eyes.`
			choice
				`	"It's okay. We can discuss that later. What happened at your meeting?"`

			`	The contrite look on Lusk's face immediately morphs into one of rage. "You want your money, you mewling buffoon? Fine! Here! Take it, and I hope I never see you again!" He rummages hastily through his pockets and pulls out a grimy credit chip before flinging it at your face. You react quickly enough to catch it, but by the time you look back at him, he is already rushing out the door.`
			`	Upon accessing the credit chip, you find that he only paid you <payment>.`
				decline
			label hearmore
			`	"Wonderful! Meet me in the spaceport in one hour. I'll tell you everything. Trust me - you're going to want to hear this." He scrambles out of his chair and rushes out of your ship, muttering something about emeralds on his way out. You take note that he still has not paid you what he promised for the trip to <planet>.`
